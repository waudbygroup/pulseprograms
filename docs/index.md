# NMR Pulse Sequence Repository

Welcome to the Waudby group repository for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) pulse sequences!

## What is this repository?

This repository provides a platform for the NMR community to share pulse sequences with rich metadata, enabling better discoverability, reproducibility, and collaboration. All sequences are TopSpin-compatible and include embedded YAML annotations for enhanced documentation.

## Key Features

- **Searchable database** of NMR pulse sequences
- **Rich metadata** embedded directly in sequence files
- **Version control** with Git-based changelog generation
- **Automatic documentation** generation with individual sequence pages

## Quick Start

1. **Browse sequences**: Check out our [sequence database](sequences/index.md)
2. **Download and use**: Copy pulse program files directly to TopSpin
3. **Contribute**: Share your sequences via [multiple pathways](contributing/index.md)
4. **Get involved**: Join discussions and help improve the repository

## Latest Sequences

*This section will be automatically populated with recently added sequences*
